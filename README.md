#Technical Frontend Test


![Prototype one](viewBefore.png =250x)![Prototype two](viewAfter.png =250x)


<em>1. How long did you spend on the coding test?</em>

    4-5 hours.
    I wanted to make a cool prototype, clean and responsive for all device.

<em>2. Please, describe your approach, and anything you want us to know.</em>

    For this simple prototype, I wanted to show how Flexbox / CSS animation are powerful.
    Less code, more simple.

<em>3. What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didnâ€™t spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to
explain what you would add.</em>

    If I have more time I would like to make more smooth animations and I'll make more responsive in "landscape mode".



Thanks for watching!
